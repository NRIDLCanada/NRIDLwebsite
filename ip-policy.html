            <h2>1. Purpose and Scope</h2>
            <p>
                The National Research Institute for Democratized Learning (NRIDL) is dedicated to fostering innovation, 
                enhancing digital literacy, and democratizing access to technology. In pursuit of these goals, NRIDL 
                recognizes the importance of creating, managing, and disseminating Intellectual Property (IP) in a manner 
                that is responsible, equitable, and legally compliant. This policy establishes clear guidelines for the 
                creation, use, protection, licensing, and distribution of IP associated with NRIDL's activities.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Applicability</h3>
            <p>
                This policy applies to all NRIDL employees, volunteers, interns, contractors, research collaborators, 
                visiting scholars, partners, sponsors, and any other individuals or entities using NRIDL's resources, 
                infrastructure, or funding. It also applies to all IP developed by or in association with NRIDL's mission, 
                regardless of the medium, form, or location of development.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="definitions" class="policy-section">
            <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
            
            <h3>Intellectual Property (IP)</h3>
            <p>
                For the purposes of this policy, IP includes, but is not limited to, inventions, patents, copyrights, 
                trademarks, service marks, logos, trade secrets, know-how, designs, source code, executables, databases, 
                documentation, images, audio-visual media, pedagogical materials, research data, analyses, graphs, 
                presentations, courseware, and any other original works of authorship or proprietary content. IP can exist 
                in both tangible and intangible forms.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Creators</h3>
            <p>
                Creators are individuals or teams who conceive, design, develop, author, or contribute to IP, including 
                NRIDL employees (full-time, part-time, and temporary), interns, volunteers, consultants, contractors, and 
                affiliated researchers.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Third-Party IP</h3>
            <p>
                Third-Party IP refers to all IP owned by entities outside of NRIDL. This includes IP incorporated into 
                NRIDL projects or resources under license, permission, or other lawful agreements.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Moral Rights</h3>
            <p>
                Moral rights refer to the personal rights of creators to be identified as the author of a work (paternity right) 
                and to object to any modification or distortion that would harm the creator's reputation (integrity right). 
                These rights are recognized differently depending on jurisdiction and will be respected in compliance with 
                applicable laws.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="ownership" class="policy-section">
            <h2>3. Ownership of IP</h2>
            
            <h3>NRIDL-Owned IP</h3>
            <p>
                Except where explicitly stated otherwise in written agreements, all IP conceived, discovered, developed, 
                or created by NRIDL employees, volunteers, or contractors within the scope of their employment, assigned 
                tasks, or using NRIDL resources or funding is owned solely by NRIDL. This includes work created during 
                regular working hours, under NRIDL direction, or through the use of NRIDL facilities, equipment, or 
                confidential information.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Collaborative IP</h3>
            <p>
                When IP is developed jointly with external organizations, institutions, or individuals, formal collaboration, 
                consortium, or joint research agreements will be established. These agreements will specify how IP ownership, 
                rights, licensing, and responsibilities are apportioned. NRIDL will strive to ensure fair and transparent 
                terms that reflect the respective contributions of all parties, the nature of the collaboration, and NRIDL's 
                commitment to open access and democratized learning.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Third-Party IP</h3>
            <p>
                NRIDL will respect the IP rights of third parties and will only use such IP under appropriate licenses, 
                permissions, or agreements. Before incorporating external IP into NRIDL projects or publications, written 
                clearance and proof of license must be obtained and filed. NRIDL will maintain a repository of relevant 
                license agreements and ensure that users, creators, and staff understand and comply with any terms or 
                restrictions.
            </p>

        <section id="licensing" class="policy-section">
            <h2>4. Use and Licensing of NRIDL IP</h2>
            
            <h3>Educational and Non-Commercial Use</h3>
            <p>
                NRIDL strongly encourages the free, non-commercial use of its IP to support educational objectives, digital 
                literacy, research, and innovation. Unless restricted by collaboration terms or third-party agreements, 
                NRIDL grants a non-exclusive, royalty-free license for non-commercial educational use of its materials, 
                provided that appropriate attribution (including original author/creator and NRIDL as the source) is given, 
                and that no modifications are made that could misrepresent the original intent. All rights reserved.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Commercial Use</h3>
            <p>
                Any commercial use of NRIDL-owned IP (including but not limited to resale, incorporation into for-profit 
                materials, commercial training programs, or the creation of derivative products for sale) requires a formal, 
                written licensing agreement approved by NRIDL management. Licensing fees, royalties, term limits, and other 
                conditions will be negotiated in each agreement, taking into account NRIDL's mission, market value of the IP, 
                and financial sustainability considerations.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Open Access and Open Source Initiatives</h3>
            <p>
                In alignment with NRIDL's mission to democratize access to knowledge and technology, where possible, NRIDL 
                will release research findings, educational materials, and software under open licenses (e.g., Creative Commons, 
                MIT, GPL) that promote broad distribution, derivative works, and transparency. Decisions regarding open access 
                or open source licensing will be made on a case-by-case basis by NRIDL's leadership, considering factors such 
                as sustainability, collaborative commitments, sponsor requirements, and the need to protect sensitive data.

        <section id="protection" class="policy-section">
            <h2>5. Protection of IP</h2>
            
            <h3>Registration and Legal Protections</h3>
            <p>
                To safeguard its IP assets, NRIDL may seek appropriate legal protections, including but not limited to 
                registrations of copyrights, patents, trademarks, and service marks in jurisdictions worldwide. NRIDL's 
                management, in consultation with legal counsel, will determine when to pursue such protections.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Confidentiality and Trade Secrets</h3>
            <p>
                All employees, volunteers, contractors, and collaborators must maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets, 
                proprietary methodologies, unpublished research, and other sensitive IP as required by law, contractual 
                agreement, or NRIDL's policies. Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) or confidentiality clauses may be employed 
                to ensure compliance. Unauthorized disclosure, use, or misappropriation of confidential information is 
                strictly prohibited.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Digital Rights Management</h3>
            <p>
                NRIDL may use DRM technologies, access controls, or other security measures to prevent unauthorized copying, 
                distribution, or modification of its digital content. Such measures will be implemented judiciously to balance 
                the need for protection with the principles of open access and ease of use.

            <h2>6. IP in Collaborative Projects</h2>
            
            <h3>Partnership and Consortium Agreements</h3>
            <p>
                For projects involving multiple organizations, NRIDL will negotiate and execute partnership agreements that 
                clarify in advance the allocation of IP rights, responsibilities, methods of managing future improvements or 
                derivatives, and revenue-sharing arrangements (if applicable). These agreements will align with NRIDL's 
                commitment to equitable access, while also respecting the contributions and rights of all parties involved.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Fair and Proportional Contribution</h3>
            <p>
                IP ownership and usage rights in joint ventures will be fairly allocated based on the nature and magnitude 
                of each party's contributions, including intellectual input, resources, funding, labor, and existing background 
                IP. Where disputes arise, independent review or mediation may be employed to reach a fair resolution.

            <h2>8. Dispute Resolution and Enforcement</h2>
            
            <h3>Internal Review</h3>
            <p>
                If an IP-related dispute, question, or complaint arises, the concerned parties should first seek resolution 
                through internal channels, including the IP officer or a designated committee. The internal review will strive 
                for a fair, transparent, and expedient resolution.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Mediation and Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
                If internal resolution efforts fail, the parties may proceed to mediation or arbitration, following the 
                procedures specified in relevant agreements or as recommended by NRIDL's legal counsel. NRIDL prefers 
                non-adversarial dispute resolution and will engage external mediation services where appropriate.
            </p>

                take legal action to enforce its IP rights or defend itself against claims of infringement. The decision to 
                pursue litigation will be made by NRIDL's management in consultation with legal counsel.
