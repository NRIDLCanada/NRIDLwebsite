                        <h3>Looking Toward 2030: Leading Technology Research for Community Benefit</h3>
                        <p>
                            By 2030, NRIDL will have established itself as a trusted voice in emerging technology research, known 
                            for translating complex innovations into accessible knowledge and practical applications that serve 
                            communities, not just corporations.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Community-Centered Research:</strong> Our research agenda is shaped by real community needs, ensuring our work on AR, semiconductors, and AI addresses practical challenges faced by educators, small businesses, and underserved populations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Local Technology Workforce Development:</strong> We partner with educational institutions to train the next generation of Canadian technology researchers, engineers, and innovators, creating pathways for youth to participate in high-value tech careers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessible Technology Knowledge:</strong> We publish research in plain language, create educational resources, and host community workshops that demystify complex technologies, empowering informed participation in technology policy and adoption decisions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ethical Technology Leadership:</strong> Our research establishes ethical frameworks and best practices for emerging technologies, ensuring Canadian communities lead in responsible innovation that prioritizes human wellbeing over pure technological advancement.</li>

                                Through our research programs, we create not just knowledge but opportunity—training local researchers, 
                                publishing accessible insights, and ensuring Canadian communities shape the trajectory of emerging technologies 
                                rather than simply consuming them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our model demonstrates that world-class technology research can be rooted in community values, accessible to 
                                all, and designed to benefit society broadly rather than concentrate power in the hands of a few tech giants.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Together, we're building a future where technological advancement and community empowerment go hand in hand.</strong></p>
