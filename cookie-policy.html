            <h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                These cookies are essential for you to browse the Site and use its features, such as accessing secure 
                areas. Without these cookies, services cannot be provided.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                These cookies collect information about how you use our Site, such as which pages you visit most often. 
                This data is aggregated and anonymous, and is used to help us improve how our Site works.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Functionality Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make (such as your language or region) and provide 
                enhanced, more personal features.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Advertising and Targeting Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They may be 
                placed by us or by third-party advertising networks with our permission. They track your browsing activity 
                across websites to build a profile of your interests and show you targeted ads on other sites. This also 
                includes social media cookies set by platforms (like Facebook or LinkedIn) to enable content sharing and 
                to track users for advertising purposes.
            </p>

        <section id="third-party" class="policy-section">
            <h2>5. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                Some cookies on our Site are operated by third parties, such as analytics providers, advertising networks, 
                and social media platforms. These third parties may use cookies to collect information about your online 
                activities over time and across different websites. We do not control these third-party cookies, and their 
                use is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties placing them.

        <section id="your-choices" class="policy-section">
            <h2>6. Your Choices and How to Control Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your preferences by 
                managing your web browser settings. Most browsers allow you to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>See what cookies you have and delete them on an individual basis.</li>
                <li>Block third-party cookies.</li>
                <li>Block cookies from particular sites.</li>
                <li>Block all cookies from being set.</li>
                <li>Delete all cookies when you close your browser.</li>

            </div>
            <p>
                You can also opt out of interest-based advertising from many third-party ad networks by visiting industry

                Initiative (NAI).

            <h2>7. Similar Technologies in Our Mobile Applications</h2>
            <p>
                Our mobile applications, including CanGrant, do not use traditional browser cookies. Instead, they use 
                other technologies that function similarly, such as Software Development Kits (SDKs) and other mobile 
                identifiers. These are used for analytics, performance, and functionality purposes, as described in our 
                Privacy Policy. You can typically control these identifiers through your mobile device's settings.
